            As a local NYC creative web designer and developer with an eagerness to build and be part of the evolution
            of the web, I am very excited to apply to the Web Designer position at B12. I believe what B12 is doing is
            so important, that B12 is using technology, specifically AI, to deliver a more effective way of creating web
            presences for businesses, while also understanding the importance of human involvement, creativity and
            connection.

            My approach to web design and development is driven by creativity and guided by user-experience,
            with an approach that orients the design and feel of the clients online presence with their personal
            brand identity. Coming from a very creative and artistic background, I have been designing websites
            using my eye for modern, beautiful and cohesive composition. I have high-level technical knowledge
            and experience in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and built my projects in ReactJS. As a CSS enthusiast,
            I am always exploring new techniques to create innovative and compelling web experiences through
            mastery of flex-box, exploration into animations and SVGâ€™s, and very sharp attention to every detail
            of light, color, shape, and layout.

            For the last year, I have been freelancing websites. Turning unstructured customer content and
            requests into into pixel-perfect web designs that work on all devices is my bread and butter.
            Prior to freelancing, I worked with the Neighborhood Start Fund, a company that supports entrepreneurs
            and start-ups from underserved areas. I worked closely with a small team, and was the lead in the design
            of the whole site. I have WYSIWYG website editor experience as well. I designed and created a site using
            Wix for a fine artist and a site for a energy medicine healer using Squarespace. I have skill in
            imagining what direction a design should go in based on the clients business, and design fast and
            creatively. I am very excited to learn B12 Design Suite!
